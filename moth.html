            <p class="info-description">This moth found in the study of the Ipe family was preciously preserved for many years by the family and was the first of its kind to be discovered. The moth was discovered by the Imperial Entomologist Shri Benaan John Ipe but was named after another colleague of Mr. Ipe. The family says that the misattribution of the discovery of the moth was the greatest regret of his life, and caused him to be bitter for the rest of his life.
