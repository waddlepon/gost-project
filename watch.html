        <h2 class="info-header">Toy Wristwatch</h2>
        <p class="info-description">Another artifact from the Ipe family, this wristwatch was owned by the daughter of Ammu Ipe. It was found buried
            in the grass near the History House of Ayemenem. Strangely, instead of telling the time, the wristwatch has
            the time 1:50 painted on it, as if the owner had wanted the time to always be the same.
